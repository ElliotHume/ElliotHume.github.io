## A challenging riddle game
----
This game is personal project I use as a tutorial for learning languages. I have written this game in Java, Python and now as a web page.
The game is very challenging and using google is almost necessary (unless you can speak a specific unmentioned language).

How to play is simple, type into the command box and hit enter to submit your answers to the puzzles. 
I would recommend the command "enigma" if you are unsure of how to start the game.
