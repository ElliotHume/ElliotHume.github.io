A link to my learning java program [Magicks Dominion](http://github.com/elliothume/magicks-dominion/).

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
