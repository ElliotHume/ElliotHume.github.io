#### Shopify Internship Problem #2, Code correction

The original function for creating a receipt is given below, the task is to improve the given code and explain the modifications

**Original code**: [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/vgyMQfek)

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <script>

  // Render HTML with a receipt for an order
  function receipt(order) {
    if (order.payment_type = "creditcard") { // changed conditional equality to assignment operator
      p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.getCardType + " " + order.payment.card_number; //card type(VISA/MasterCard etc.) and number)
    } else if (order.payment_type == "paypal") {
      p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.paypal_info;
    } else if (order.payment_type == "manual") {
      p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.manual_payment_info;
    } else if (order.payment_type == "free") {
      p = "Payment info: This order was free!"; //Free order or promotional item
    } else if
    {
      p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.default_payment_info;//default order info
    }
    if (order.payment_type != "free") {
       p = p + "<p> was charged " + order.amount_in_dollars + "$" + "</p>";
    }

    html = "<p>" + "Your order of" + order.products.name + "has been received" + "</p>" + "<p>" + p + "</p>";
    document.write("<h1> Order receipt details </h1>" + html);
  }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Modified function:**
Changes made are described in in-line comments. 
(also on GitHub: [Shopify2](https://github.com/ElliotHume/Shopicruit-tasks/blob/master/Shopify2.html))

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Order receipt</title>
</head>

<body>

  <h1 id="order_Receipt"></h1>
  <p id="order_Information"></p>
  <p id="order_Payment"></p>

  <script>
  //I have removed all previous comments for the purpose that I can better explain what I did on each line.

  "use strict"; //for style and forward compatibilty
  function receipt(order) {
    var p; // define variables for clarity and ease of renovation
    var orderReceipt;
    switch(order.payment_type) { //switch-case statement, again for clarity, making it easier to upgrade in the future
      case "creditcard":
        p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.getCardType + " " + order.payment.card_number;
        break;
      case "paypal":
        p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.paypal_info;
        break;
      case "manual":
        p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.manual_payment_info;
        break;
      case "free":
        p = "Payment info: This order was free!";
        break;
      default: //also fixes the "else if" into "else" error from original code
        p = "Payment info: " + order.payment.default_payment_info;
    }

    if (order.payment_type != "free") {
       p = p + " was charged $" + parseFloat(order.amount_in_dollars).toFixed(2); //put the "$" in front and rounded and converted to number just in case (better safe than sorry).
    }

    orderReceipt = "Your order of " + order.products.name + " has been received";// added spacing for finesse(detail) and clarity

    //Instead of using document.write() I have switched to document.getElementById() for the different paragraphs and header,
    //not only because it is efficient but also because document.write() would overrite anything previously rendered.
    //This also allowed me to remove all of the HTML tags(like <p> and <h1>) inside of the variables which again helps with clarity.
    document.getElementById("order_Receipt").innerHTML = "Order receipt details";
    document.getElementById("order_Information").innerHTML = orderReceipt;
    document.getElementById("order_Payment").innerHTML = p;
  }

  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
