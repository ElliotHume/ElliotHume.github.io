### University capstone project and personal project
Runic Warfare is the game that I created in partnership with Ian Hume and Eric Du for our university capstone project. The game is a networked PvP magic duelling game. We originally created this game as a PC game, but in the summer of 2020 I personally expanded the game to include VR gameplay for the Oculus Quest.

I go into more detail in my [blog post about Runic Warfare](https://elliothume.github.io/RunicWarfare/) and I encourage you to check out the game trailer there, or on the GitHub page linked below.
