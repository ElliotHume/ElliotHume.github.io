### Introduction ###
Runic Warfare is the game that I created in partnership with Ian Hume and Eric Du for our university capstone project. The assignment was to create a game with two novel aspects: a novel gameplay element, and a novel interaction method. For our novel gameplay element we went with the rune-drawing spellcasting mechanic that is the core mechanic for the game. This type of mechanic has been done before, in [Harry Potter Wizards Unite](https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com/) and [OrbusVR](https://orbusvr.com/) but we felt that we could try to improve this mechanic to make it more satisfying and enhance the fantasy that our game is trying to promote. Our novel interaction method is that the game would be designed to play with a drawing tablet (but still keep the mouse as a viable option). With these two aspects chosen, we got to work on the core gameplay.

### Brief Gameplay Description ###
The game is be a real time combative duel between two players in a closed arena. Each player must cast spells to defeat the opposing player. To cast a spell, players will draw the glyph associated with that spell on their tablet and swipe upwards diagonally to the right or left to cast in that direction. There are an arsenal of 7 spells available to cast, that perform different kinds of offensive or defensive abilities. Most spells are also tied to player movement as well so that you can dodge incoming projectiles if you are quick with your castings. Players must proactively create their own strategy to attack their opponent, and reactively dodge their opponentâ€™s attacks to gain a competitive edge.

A full game will consist of up to 5 rounds. To win the match, a player needs to win 3 out of 5 rounds. Each round will have a short timer (60 seconds) to reflect the fast pace of the game. If the round timer reaches zero before a player is defeated, the player closest to the center of the arena will win the round.

## VR Conversion ##
We originally created this game as a PC game, but in the summer of 2020 I personally expanded the game to also include VR gameplay for the Oculus Quest. I go into more detail on the GitHub page (linked below) and I encourage you to check out the game trailer there!
