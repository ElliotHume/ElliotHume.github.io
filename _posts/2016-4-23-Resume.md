  // Render HTML with a receipt for an order
  function receipt(order) {

    }
    if (order.payment_type != "free") {
       p = p + "<p> was charged " + order.amount_in_dollars + "$" + "</p>";
    }

    html = "<p>" + "Your order of" + order.products.name + "has been received" + "</p>" + "<p>" + p + "</p>";
    document.write("<h1> Order receipt details </h1>" + html);
  }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
